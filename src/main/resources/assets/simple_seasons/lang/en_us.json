Every time the season progress updates in a world, a packet is sent to all clients in that world containing the new season progress. Subsequently, all clients in that world will reload the world's color and schedule a rebuild for all chunks.\nIncreasing this value will result in packets being sent more often to all clients in a world and thus season colors will update more often on all clients in that world. Decreasing this value will result in packets being sent less often to all clients in a world and thus season colors will update less often on all clients in that world. This config option can be performance intensive if set too high.",
